	Our program's basis is that everything is a "planet." With our design even moons, the sun, and even Pluto are all planets. We have a planet class which does most of the heavy lifting for our information. The planet class is a subset of a solar system class which we use to manipulate all the planets. The information for all planets is stored away in txt files.  In the beginning of the program, we use read all the files to get the proper information stored away in the program, then we proceed to drawing everything out.
